Week 0: Learning about Scratch

Problem Set 0: Create a Scratch project with at least
- At least 2 sprites
- At least 3 scripts
- At least 1 condition, 1 loop, and 1 variable
- At least 1 sound

Project description: This scratch program tracks the user's mouse cursor, and allows the user to move a cat around. Music loops in the background. The objective is to avoid the ghost following the cursor, as well as all the randomly appearing animals bouncing around the screen, while trying to collect "power-ups." The random sprites speed up as time progresses, and at the end of the game the user is told how long they survived.

Note - Requires Scratch 2 to open/edit file.
