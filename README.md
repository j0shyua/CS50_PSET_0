Week 0: Learning about Scratch

Problem Set 0: Create a Scratch project with at least
- At least 2 sprites
- At least 3 scripts
- At least 1 condition, 1 loop, and 1 variable
- At least 1 sound

Project description: This scratch program tracks the user's mouse cursor, and allows the user to move a cat around. The objective is to avoid all the randomly appearing animals bouncing around the screen, while trying to collect "power-ups." The random sprites speed up as time progresses, and at the end of the game the user is told how long they survived.
